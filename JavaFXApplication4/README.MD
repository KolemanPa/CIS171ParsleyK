# Hangman Picture
This application displays a javafx GUI with the common word game "Hangman" picture displayed
## Created by
This application was created by Koleman Parsley with help from previous hand-coded projects
### Analysis
The "Problem" was to create a picture only using the javafx.shape objects, I used only circles and lines
### Design
The design was pretty simple as a sample picture was provided to us, overall its a simple design, just a lot of tweaking
### Testing
The testing process was the hardest, it took MANY attempts to get the lines and circles in the right positons so it didnt look awkward
I started off with the "Head" of the guy, from there i was able to tweek it until it landed in a good spot to fit the rest of the 
picture in the frame. from there I used simple math to figure out the body, arms and legs! the hardes part was "Tinkering" with the 
coordinates to find the right place so it didnt look awkward
