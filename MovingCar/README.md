# Moving Car Project
This application displays a javafx GUI with school bus moving forward or backward
## Created By
This application was created by Koleman Parsley with the help from REVEL assignments
## Analysis
The "Problem" was to create a interactive school bus program that moves forward, backward, and pauses by clicking the bottom buttons
## Design
the design required a ton of tweaking getting the shapes in the right configuration so it looks like a car
## Testing
This program required a TON of testing and debugging, my first couple attempts got most of the way then a huge flaw showed up causing
me to "redo" the project. First i tried to put the car into a pane and moving the pane slowly, this didnt end up working. i then
configured the object to move at, but it would only move if you clicked and continued clicking the button, after many attempts
and a ton of google i was able to add an animation function to make it run on its own smoothley
